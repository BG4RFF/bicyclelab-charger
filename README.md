# 85-110W single output battery charger

This is an opensource lithium-ion battery charger that use laptop power adapter as input.

## Features

1. boost input from 18.5V - 4.7A to 42V (or 47.2V) with ~95% of efficiency 
2. stage charging; current control then voltage control
3. full protections: Short circuit / Overload / Over voltage / Over temperature
4. 1 LED indicator for charging status
5. BMS features; Balancing charge on each cell [TODO]
6. custom number of serial cells 5..12
7. small size, only 30x90x8mm

## Power stage (battery charge)

This if the fourth prototype release. The purpose of this board is to manage the charge  
of a 10/11 serial lithium-ion cell with an input given by a laptop ac adapter (currently the apple magsafe1 85W). 
The software is mainly a PID control based on the MAX_POWER for the fast charge and the BATTERY_VOLTAGE for 
the constant charge. The size of the board is about 30x90mm


## Cell balancing and protection
This project is targeted for each individual cell. The purpose of this project is to make a simple cascading 
module to manage over/under voltage/temperatur for each cell. The first prototype is still not available for testing. 

1. an overvoltage measurement is triggering a passive balancing for the cell
2. TODO - implement an isolated one wire communication to broadcast,
  * undervoltage signal
  * over temperature signal
